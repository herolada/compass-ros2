/**
 * \brief Compute various azimuth values based on a magnetometer, IMU orientation and possibly also GPS coordinates.
 *
 * Because there is no well established Azimuth message in ROS, this node publishes our custom compass_interfaces/Azimuth
 * as well as a few other formats that are capable of carrying orientation information. It also offers the azimuth
 * values in both radians and degrees, because radians are the ROS standard, while degrees are more used in the
 * geographic area. There are tens of possible combinations of the output data formats, so each of the published
 * topics has a boolean parameter that enables it. By default, there is only one enabled output topic.
 *
 * Explaining some basic terms so that you know what output is the right for you:
 *
 * Orientation:
 * - NED (North-East-Down): Azimuth will be 0 pointing to north, and increases clockwise. This is consistent with the
 *                          azimuth used in cartography and by tourists.
 * - ENU (East-North-Up): Azimuth will be 0 pointing to east, and increases counter-clockwise. This is consistent with
 *                        REP-103 and robot_localization package.
 * References for north:
 * - Magnetic: points towards the magnetic north of Earth (travels in time).
 * - Geographic ("true"): points towards the geographic Earth (i.e. the WGS84 North Pole). It is static in time.
 * - UTM: points in the north direction on the cartesian UTM grid (similar to Geographic, but it can slightly diverge
 *        at the edges of UTM maps). You probably want this azimuth reference for navigation tasks in UTM coordinates.
 *
 * Magnetic azimuth can be computed directly from the magnetometer and IMU orientation. To compute the other two
 * references, you need to provide the latitude, longitude, altitude and time in addition to the magnetometer and
 * IMU orientation. These are the required inputs to compute magnetic declination and UTM grid convergence, which are
 * the offsets by which geographic and UTM references differ from the magnetic. This is why this compass node subscribes
 * to the GPS fix messages. Until at least a single GPS fix message is received, neither geographic- nor UTM-referenced
 * data are published. If you do not have a GPS receiver, you can alternatively provide these values in parameters.
 *
 * For the magnetometer to work correctly, it is required to measure its bias. This node listens on the `imu/mag_bias`
 * topic for this measurement, and until at least one message arrives, the node will not publish anything. If you do not
 * have a node publishing the bias, you can alternatively provide it via parameters. Depending on the application, it
 * may be required to re-estimate the bias from time to time even during runtime.
 *
 * Subscribed topics:
 * - `imu/data` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`): Output from an IMU or an orientation filtering algorithm. It should have valid
 *                                   contents of `orientation` and at least roll and pitch should be estimated as
 *                                   well as possible (relative to the gravity vector). These messages should come at
 *                                   the same rate as the magnetometer data (or faster). Make sure the orientation
 *                                   is reported in ENU frame (use imu_transformer package to transform it from NED).
 * - `imu/mag` (`sensor_msgs/MagneticField`): 3-axis magnetometer raw measurements (bias not removed) (disabled by param
 *                                            `~subscribe_mag_unbiased`).
 * - `imu/mag_bias` (`sensor_msgs/MagneticField`): Bias of the magnetometer. This value will be subtracted from the
 *                                                 incoming magnetometer measurements. Messages on this topic do not
 *                                                 need to come repeatedly if the bias does not change. Disabled by
 *                                                 param `~subscribe_mag_unbiased`.
 * - `imu/mag_unbiased` (`sensor_msgs/MagneticField`): 3-axis magnetometer unbiased measurements (enabled by param
 *                                                     `~subscribe_mag_unbiased`).
 * - `gps/fix` (`sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`, optional): GPS fix messages from which the latitude, longitude, altitude and
 *                                                  current year can be read. These are further used to compute
 *                                                  magnetic declination and UTM grid convergence factor if requested.
 * - TF: This node requires a (usually static) transform between `~frame` and the frame ID of the IMU and magnetometer
 *       messages.

 *
 * Parameters:
 * - All the `publish_*` parameters mentioned above.
 * - Please note that you cannot combine both `~subscribe_mag_unbiased` and `~publish_mag_unbiased` set to true.
 *   Such configuration is invalid and the node will not start.
 * - `~frame` (string, default `base_link`): Frame into which the IMU and magnetometer data should be transformed.
 * - `~low_pass_ratio` (double, default 0.95): The azimuth is filtered with a low-pass filter. This sets its
 *                                             aggressivity (0 means raw measurements, 1 means no updates).
 * - `~initial_mag_bias_x` (double, no default, optional): Magnetometer bias in the X axis.
 * - `~initial_mag_bias_y` (double, no default, optional): Magnetometer bias in the Y axis.
 * - `~initial_mag_bias_z` (double, no default, optional): Magnetometer bias in the Z axis.
 *   - If you specify any of the `~initial_mag_bias_*` params, the node does not need to receive the bias messages.
 * - `~initial_lat` (double, no default, optional): Latitude in degrees.
 * - `~initial_lon` (double, no default, optional): Longitude in degrees.
 *   - If you specify both `~initial_lat` and `~initial_lon`, the node does not need to receive the GPS fix messages.
 * - `~initial_alt` (double, default 0): Altitude in meters (it is usually okay to omit it and use the default).
 * - `~initial_year` (int, no default, optional): If set, overrides the current time for declination computation.
 * - `~initial_variance` (double, default 0): Variance of the measurement used at startup (in rad^2).
 * - `~magnetic_declination` (double, no default, optional, radians): If this parameter is set, the magnetic models are
 *                                                                    ignored and this value for declination is forced.
 *                                                                    This can be useful either if you know the value
 *                                                                    in advance or in simulation.
 * - `~magnetic_models_path` (string, defaults to the pre-installed directory): Directory with WMM magnetic field
 *      models. You usually do not need to use other than the preinstalled models. But if you do, specify the path to
 *      the custom models directory here.
 * - `~magnetic_model` (string, defaults to autodetection by year): Name of the magnetic field model to use. If omitted,
 *      an automated decision is made based on the current year (or `~initial_year`, if set). This model is used for
 *      computing magnetic declination.
